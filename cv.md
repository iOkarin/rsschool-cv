## About me

**Hey there!**   I am a 23 year old Padawan (a bit late for a Padawan, you must admit).  One way or another, having received a higher professional education, I thought: “What did I spend 5 years of my life on?” I was not at all interested in working by profession, so I began to choose a profession to which I would devote my life.  The choice was a front-end developer.  I am here to get new knowledge and become better and better.  And rest assured, no one can stop me!  **Let the Force be with you!**
